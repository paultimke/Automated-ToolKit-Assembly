# Automated-ToolKit-Assembly
Manually assembling kits of screws, nuts, bolts, etc is a repetitive activity that, when done by a person for long periods of time, can lead to variability in the assembled kits due to fatigue of the worker. Additionally, being a repetitive task, means that it can be easily automated and the worker's time can be redirected to something more creative to add more value to the company.

This project is a Desktop application to control an automated system in a warehouse or assembling factory to assemble tooling kits (nuts, screws, bolts, etc) with an articulated robot arm. The project also includes automatic Inventory control with email notifications on shortage conditions and a Computer-Vision-based system to automatically assess the kits after assembly and verify they are correctly made.
